 Welcome to the repository of "Model-Free Controlled Variable Selection via Data Splitting"!

This repository provides the implementation code for the paper "Model-Free Controlled Variable Selection via Data Splitting" (published in SCIENTIA SINICA Mathematica). The work constructs a novel model-free variable selection procedure while controlling the false discovery rate in sufficient dimension reduction. 

If this work contributes to your research or inspires further developments, we deeply appreciate you citing this paper and giving your star. Your support is greatly appreciated!
